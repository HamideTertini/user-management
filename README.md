#  FrontEnd Internship Challenge ‚Äì User Management App

## üîπ Project Overview

This is a **User Management Application** built entirely by me for the **Frontend Internship Challenge**. The app demonstrates advanced React skills including component architecture, state management with Redux Toolkit, data fetching via RTK Query, routing with React Router, and UI design using Ant Design & Tailwind CSS.

The application allows you to **view, search, sort, add, edit, and delete users**, with a professional and responsive interface.
